# mobile-POGS-project
This project is a React Native application that allows users to select and order vegetables and fruits. Users can choose items from a picker, specify quantities, and add them to a cart. The application then calculates the total cost of the order. It features a visually appealing user interface with images, styled text, and interactive buttons.
